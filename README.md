# US-Lithuanian-Keyboard

Why?
====

Switching between US and Lithuanian keyboards is pain. Especially when you need to type numbers, etc.

In Ubuntu there's a keyboard layout named Lithuanian (US keyboard with Lithuanian letters).
The layout works by assigning Lithuanian letters to upper row (numbers) with Alt key

Fork changes
===

Lithuanian letters are inverted with numbers. You need to press Alt key to type numbers instead of letters now.

Installation
============

These may be installed by copying them to the Keyboard Layouts folder within /Library or ~/Library;
then they are enabled via the Input Sources (Input in 10.5 and earlier) tab of the
Language & Text (International in 10.5 and earlier) module within System Preferences.

    wget -O ~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/US-Lithuanian.keylayout https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergejvoronov/US-Lithuanian-Keyboard/master/US-Lithuanian.keylayout
